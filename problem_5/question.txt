5. Write unit tests for the program below. Test the Subtract and the Add functions. Make use of
structs and slices to satisfy the following operations with sets of numbers:
● For Addition:
○ 1 and 2
○ 3 and 4
○ 5 and 6
● For Subtraction:
○ 2 and 1
○ 4 and 3
○ 6 and 5
package math
func Subtract(x, y int) (res int) {
return x - y
}
func Add(x, y int) (res int) {
return x + y
}
