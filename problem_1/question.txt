1. Create a small program which accepts two slices of colors. It must return a slice containing
the colors that appear in either or both slices.
c1 := []string{"Red", "Black", "White"}
c2 := []string{"Black", "Yellow", "Orange"}
should return in any order a slice which should have no duplicates.:
[Red Black White Yellow Orange]
